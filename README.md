# Mastodon Moderation Behavior Analysis
This project analyzes moderation behaviors on Mastodon instances by applying network science techniques. It utilizes cosine similarity and Louvain community detection to identify clusters of moderators based on their actions. The results are visualized through network graphs and heatmaps using NetworkX, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## üß† Project Overview
Objective: To uncover patterns and communities among Mastodon moderators by analyzing their behavior.

## Techniques Used:
- Cosine similarity for measuring behavioral similarity between moderators.
- Louvain algorithm for community detection within the moderator network.
- Visualization of networks and heatmaps to represent findings.

## Tools & Libraries: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas

## üìÅ Repository Structure
- Moderation Behavior Analysis on Mastodon.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
